# Meet-The-Stranger
## The project is a real-time communication platform that facilitates seamless peer-to-peer interactions. It leverages `WebRTC` technology to enable audio and video conversations, along with text chat capabilities. Users can communicate directly with one another using their unique `Socket IDs`, providing a secure and private channel for conversation.


## Key Features:

* #### Call Stranger or Friend: Connect with random users for spontaneous conversations, either through text chat or video call.
